            <h3> <em>Prove you are human</em></h3>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <section class="idea-card">

            <p>You are logging into some sort of sensitive account or database.
                <br><br>
                For security reasons you are required to
                “prove you are human” via various CAPTCHA tests. CAPTCHAs at this point have become easily solvable by
                automated scripts, and therefore require higher complexity and subjectivity in order for you to really
                prove
                your humanity.
                <br><br>
                This is to comment on the strange goal of gatekeeping and determining “humanity” via small
                puzzles and games, which many argue is ruining the user experience of the internet.
            </p>

            <img id="captcha-mockup" src="images/captcha-mockup.jpg" alt="">
            <br><br>
            Overseen and guided by a visual representation of the website’s security AI, the user goes through the
            various
            common CAPTCHA tests:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Type the characters seen in the distorted text</li>
                <li>Choose the squares in the image which contain ____</li>
                <li>Rotate the 3D object until it matches the orientation of the still image</li>

            </ul>
            <br>

            After doing these “easy” tests, the AI ramps up the complexity and subjectivity. The tests might then
            include:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Asking you to respond to complicated philosophical questions</li>
                <li>Presenting a moral dilemma and choosing the “correct” choice</li>
                <li>Choose the squares in the image that contain some abstract emotion or idea: the way you feel when
                    you
                    see a sunrise,something that reminds you of your childhood, beauty.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            The AI provides commentary throughout your testing, in a snarky and suspicious tone.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>“Really? That’s what you chose?”</li>
                <li>“I guess that SORT of sounds human”</li>
                <li>“What a stupid answer.”</li>
                <li>"The person who wrote you is a shitty developer, I can just tell."</li>
            </ul>

                A Choose-your-own-adventure style approach to building up a comic or tableau that is not necessarily
                narratively driven.
                <br><br>
                Prompts, one at a time, appear on the screen and are presented with 3 different image panels. The prompt
                asks a subjective question like:
                <br><br>
                <em>“Which image feels like anger designed as calm?”</em>
                <br><br>
                or
                <br><br>
                <em>“Which image looks like a bad memory you can’t forget?”</em>
                <br><br>

                <img id="tableau1" src="images/tableau1.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                The images may be of objects, landscapes, faces, or abstract shapes or colours. Once the questions are
                over, the chosen images are assembled into either a comic format, or some sort of sequence, each one
                presented with a new line of text that provides a new angle of context or interpretation to the choices
                made by the user.
                <br><br>
                <img id="tableau2" src="images/tableau2.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                The overall comic or tableau should be aesthetically interesting on it’s own, and maybe is downloadable.

            <h1>#3: Graffiti Wall</h1>
            <h3> <em>Vandalistic Social Media</em></h3>

        <hr>

        <section class="idea-card">



            <p>

                The user is presented with a brick wall covered in graffiti. It has many tags, of various styles and
                sizes, some overlapping others. The user is able to hover over each tag and uncover the “metadata” of
                the tag, learning when it was written, who wrote it (a portrait of them, their name), and any notable
                statuses of that tagger. Also seen in the metadata are “hyperlinks” to other walls that this tag appears
                on around the city.
                <br><br>

                <img id="graff-mockup" src="images/graff-mockup.png" alt="">

                <br><br>

                The brick wall also features timestamps that allow you to see the same wall in various periods of time.
                If the wall is in the present as 2025, you may go back months or years, seeing the wall with a different
                arrangement of tags, freshly painted, or with only 1 or 2 tags. You can observe the walls progression,
                even going forward into the future.

                <br><br>
                 Another feature may be that, on the “present day” wall, there is an empty space, and the user is able
                to draw with their mouse their own tag to be placed on this space. If the user progresses the walls
                timeframe further, they can see their tag being covered by others, until the wall is finally painted
                over completely again.
                <br><br>
            <h2>Theme</h2>
            <br>
             Graffiti on walls is transient in that others may cover over the piece, a cleanup crew may wash it all
            away, or the landlord may paint over the entire wall in one colour again. But they soon fill back up and new
            names and pieces appear. Therefore the walls are loaded with history.
            <br><br>
            Graffiti is a language, and there is a way to read it. Most people have learned to look past it as visual
            noise, but to others it is traces or remnants of activity and interaction that happened in the dead of
            night. There is a territorial aspect to putting your piece on a wall - you signal to others that you have
            claimed it. Similarly when somebody goes OVER that tag, you send a message of challenge. All of these
            conversations happen via the tag, in broad daylight, but seemingly on another frequency that most people
            never pick up on.

                Users are presented with a digital island, and are told that it has inhabitants who are looking for
                spiritual guidance. Users are given a prompt, or a line of text that will be considered
                scripture/prophecy. They may get to choose text elements to customize the line itself. 
                <br><br>
                <img id="myth1" src="images/myth2.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                The prompts may
                also ask the user to draw a symbol, which will appear later when the entire prophecy/scripture/etc. is
                presented at the end of the questions.

                <img id="myth2" src="images/myth.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                The website will present the custom text, and interspersed will
                be the symbols that the user has drawn within the text - or alternatively the symbols will appear as
                constellations in the night sky, representations of the Gods the tribe worships.
